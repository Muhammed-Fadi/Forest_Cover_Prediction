#Forest_Cover_Prediction 
üå≤ Forest Cover Prediction
üìò Overview

The Forest Cover Prediction project aims to classify the type of forest cover based on various cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, and aspect. This is a classic supervised machine learning problem, often based on the UCI Forest CoverType dataset.

The goal is to predict the forest cover type (from 1 to 7) for each observation using environmental features collected from forested areas.

üß† Objectives

Predict the forest cover type from cartographic features.

Build and compare multiple ML models to achieve high accuracy.

Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Provide insights into which environmental features most influence forest type.
